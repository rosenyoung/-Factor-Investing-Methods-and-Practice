对《因子投资：方法与实践》一书中的示例进行实证/ Validations of examples in the book "Factor Investing: Methods and Practice"

"Factor Investing: Methods and Practice" is a useful guide book to multi-fator models and "factor investing". The author Shi Chuan got his Bachelor's and Master's degree from Tsinghua University and PhD of engineering from MIT. This book illustrates the "factors" in the academia and checks the performance of most popular factors in the Chinese stock market. Unfortunately, there is no English version of this book. I would like to validate the examples(most in Chapter 3) in this book by myself, and wish that through sharing my experience, you can also learn something from my work.
